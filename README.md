This is just a little game I'm playing around with. It's built using [gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui).
To play it, just clone this repo and run `go run cmd/main.go`


ideas:

1. Maps that have fixed objectives instead of completely random
2. footprints where you've been
3. AI enemies: patrol (with vision cone), follow your tracks, homing on your location (unleashed on 100% threat - game over when they catch you)
4. auto-move on double-tap input
5. Items you can use - build pylons, portals, or things
6. Change the direction of the bit stream
7. Power-ups: slow down bit stream, immune to negative bits, speed up looting, multiplier on loot value
8. Walls and things that interrupt the bit stream - give shelter
